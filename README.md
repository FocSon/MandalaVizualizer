# Note for the devs who wants to add Mandalas to the library

the lib is well commented so you can optimise or create mandala(s).
All you have to do is to create a new function wich take for argument the background then copy and paste the code below the "set up turtle" comment you can find at every begining of a function, this code allow the turtle to write into a Tkinter background,  provide you the center of the screen (y and x variables) and ignite an invisible pen at speed 0 (best speed) in the middle of the screen
